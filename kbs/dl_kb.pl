/**

<module> Knowledge Base under Description Logic as Base Logic

This module encapsulates a data structure for managing and accessing a
single or multiple Description Logic knowledge bases.

Knowledge bases are identified through a unique identifier that be can
be any fully grounded Prolog term, e.g. a name such as 'kb1', or a
list of ground actions, for example to indicate that the KB is the
result of progressing through this action sequence.

A special identifier is 'userdb', indicating that the KB works
directly on facts of the dynamic predicate initially/1 inside user
space. Otherwise, KB formulas will be stored inside this module as
facts of the dynamic predicate kb_axiom/2.
