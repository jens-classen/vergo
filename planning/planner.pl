/**

<module> Planner

This module implements a simple progression-based planner for Golog.

It uses the iterative-deepening version of the well-known A* algorithm
with a heuristic function that is a simplified variant of the "ignore
delete lists" relaxation. More specifically, in the computation of the
heuristic value it is assumed that all actions can be executed
simultaneously.

Planning is possible for all action theories for which progression is
supported, however the heuristic function only takes positive effects
for typed fluents subject to the closed-world assumption (CWA) into
consideration. This means that planning will work best for action
theories that can be mapped to PDDL's ADL fragment.

So far, action costs and metrics are not supported.
