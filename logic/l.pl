/**

<module> L

This module implements the logic 'L', i.e. first-order logic with a
countable set of standard names as the fixed universe of discourse, as
described in

Hector J. Levesque and Gerhard Lakemeyer: The Logic of Knowledge
Bases. MIT Press, 2001.

Here, a standard name is any Prolog atom starting with '#',
e.g. '#1', '#2', '#bob'.
