=================================================
Getting Started
=================================================

It is required that the environment variable PATH_GOLOG is set to root
directory of this software, e.g. via

$ export PATH_GOLOG=/home/user/esgolog/

=================================================
Directories
=================================================

The code is divided into the following subdirectories:

- agents:

  Contains agents interfaces. These are required for the actual
  execution of and interaction with an agent program.

- examples:

  Example domain definitions for agents.

- external:

  Contains source code packages for external tools used in this
  software (see 'Dependencies' below).

- projection:

  Code implementing regression and progression methods.

- reasoning:

  Contains different implementations and interfaces for backend
  reasoners (propositional and FOL).

- temp:

  Temporary files are put here.

- tools:

  Conversion tools such as PDDL parser.

- transfinal:

  Contains various definitions for Golog program semantics.

- lib:

  Various libraries (utilities, environment variables).

- verification:

  Contains implementations of different verification methods.


=================================================
Dependencies
=================================================

There are the following dependencies to external tools and systems:

1. The E Theorem Prover

   To use FOL theorem proving, we require that the 'eprover'
   executable is visible in $PATH. The system has been developed and
   tested with the (currently) most recent version "1.8-001
   Gopaldhara". E can be downloaded from 

   http://www.eprover.org 

   and installed manually. For some distributions such as Fedora,
   there are also prepackaged versions. Installation on Fedora then
   for example is via

   $ sudo yum install E.x86_64
 
2. The NuSMV Model Checker

   To use verification based on abstraction and model checking, we
   require that the 'nusmv' executable is visible in $PATH. The system
   has been developed and tested with the (currently) most recent
   version 2.5.4, which can be downloaded from

   http://nusmv.fbk.eu

   and installed manually according to the installation instructions
   given there.

3. Graphviz/dot

   for visualization
