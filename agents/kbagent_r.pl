This file presents an interface to a knowledge-based agent in a
dynamic environment, where both projection and updates are handled
using regression, and reasoning about knowledge is reduced to
first-order theorem proving according to the representation theorem
from

Hector J. Levesque and Gerhard Lakemeyer: The Logic of Knowledge
Bases. MIT Press, 2001.

We thus follow Levesque's functional view on knowlede-based
systems. Details are described in

Jens Claßen and Gerhard Lakemeyer: Foundations for Knowledge-Based
Programs using ES. In Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Principles
of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2006), pages 318-328,
AAAI Press, 2006.

Jens Claßen: Planning and Verification in the Agent Language Golog.
PhD Thesis, Department of Computer Science, RWTH Aachen University,
2013.

The code herein (and the imported files) represents a complete
re-implementation, but builds upon the lessons learnt from

Marius Grysla. Implementation and Evaluation of an ES-based Golog
System. Bachelor's Thesis, Department of Computer Science, RWTH Aachen
University, May 2010.

and an even earlier implementation of a propositional fragment due to
Yuxiao Hu (2006). The most important improvement is the usage of a
first-order extension of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for keeping
the size of regressed formulas manageable (cf. the 'fobdd' module).
